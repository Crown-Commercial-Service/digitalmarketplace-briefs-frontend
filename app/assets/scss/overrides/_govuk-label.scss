// We want to ensure that govuk-label components are consistent with existing
// labels. To do this we change the default label class to be styled like a
// medium heading. This style was copied from
// https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/v2.13.0/src/components/label/_label.scss#L27-L30
//
// TODO: Remove/move this to digitalmarketplace-govuk-frontend when ready

.govuk-label {
  @include govuk-text-colour;
  @include govuk-font($size: 24, $weight: bold);

  display: block;

  margin-bottom: govuk-spacing(2);
}
